gol-cloj

There are many, many versions of the Game Of Life in github I am sure for every language imaginable. 

This is a clojure implementation I did quickly based on a code retreat we did at work that I checked in so I could share with my clojure-inquisitive
coworkers. I'm sure there are more optimizations that could be done, that the code could be more idomatic in places - that said, its not bad.

Of course, I reserve the right to tweak mercilessly in the future.
